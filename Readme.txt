# This frame work is implemented using BDD with rest assure java
# As pre-requisite in your machine install Java, Maven

#Import the project to your eclipse working set
#This is hybrid framework where we can run the testcases using Testng or Bdd test runner 

# For reporting implmented the extent reports, along with this we have multiple reports like testng, sure fire, junit, cucumber.xml reports
# for logs purpose implemented the log4j 

#Since this is maven framework all the dependencies will be downloaded using pom.xml file

#For better maintainance of the code, seperated requriements, stepdefinitions, resources, validations packages

#using mvn test we can run the cucumber tests from console and we can integrate this as part of cicd

# For advance reports we can also integrate this framework using zephyr plugin where we will post the results to zephyr plugin with pass/fail status
